OctoAcme organizes work around a clear project lifecycle that moves from initiation through planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Initiation centers on a lightweight Project One-pager that captures the problem, objective, success metrics, stakeholders, and high‑level timeline; projects only move into planning after success metrics, stakeholder alignment, and team availability are confirmed. Planning breaks approved initiatives into prioritized, shippable backlog items using a standard template (title, description, acceptance criteria, estimate, owner, links) and captures risks and dependencies in a Risk Register with owners and mitigations. Execution uses a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and a disciplined PR workflow (small PRs, link to issue and acceptance criteria, CI checks, and at least one approval) to keep work flowing and traceable.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit and focused on cross-functional collaboration. Product Managers (PdMs) set the vision, define outcomes and success metrics, and prioritize the backlog; Project Managers (PMs) coordinate schedules, risks, communications, and preserve project artifacts; developers implement features, write tests and docs, and participate in reviews and estimates; QA validates acceptance and runs manual or automated verification. Stakeholders and sponsors provide inputs and approvals, while escalation paths (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor, with special handling for security incidents) ensure rapid attention for blockers or business‑impacting issues.

Communication is regular and structured to surface progress, risks, and decisions: daily standups for immediate progress and blockers, a weekly delivery sync to show progress and flagged risks, PM+PdM weekly alignment, and monthly stakeholder updates. The docs recommend using a single source of truth (project README or release doc) and templates for weekly status and incident communications to keep updates consistent. Blockers are triaged at the team level and escalated according to defined levels; the Risk Register is reviewed regularly and updated in weekly syncs to keep mitigation actions visible.

Quality and release practices emphasize automation, testing, and safe deploys. The team requires unit and integration tests, smoke or end‑to‑end checks for critical flows, and security scanning as part of CI; PRs should pass tests and linting before review. Releases follow a standardized checklist (pre-release validation, staging smoke tests, automated production pipelines when possible, and post‑deploy verification) and include rollback and incident playbooks so failures can be contained and triaged. Continuous improvement is closed‑looped via retrospectives that surface 2–3 prioritized action items, track owners and due dates, and feed measurable improvements back into the backlog.
