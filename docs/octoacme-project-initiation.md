# OctoAcme — Project Initiation Guide

## Purpose
Define the initial steps to validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan.

## When to use
Whenever a new project idea or feature proposal is ready to be explored.

## Goals
- Confirm business need and measurable outcome
- Identify stakeholders & champions
- Define success criteria and initial timeline
- Decide go/no-go for planning

## Minimum Deliverables
- Project One-pager (Problem, Goal, Success Metrics)
- Stakeholder list & communication plan
  - Include cross-functional stakeholders (Operations, Security, UX, Data, Support)
- High-level timeline and key milestones
- Initial risk list
  - **Security Lead**: Security and compliance risks
  - **Operations Manager**: Infrastructure and operational risks
- Resource needs (team roles, rough effort estimate)
  - Consider which cross-functional roles are needed (see [octoacme-role-onboarding-checklist.md](octoacme-role-onboarding-checklist.md))
