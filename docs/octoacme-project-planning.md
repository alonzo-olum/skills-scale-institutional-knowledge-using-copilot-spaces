# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
   - Include relevant cross-functional roles (Operations, Security, UX/UI, Data, Support)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
   - **UX/UI Designer**: Contributes design requirements and user experience criteria
   - **Security Lead**: Defines security and compliance requirements
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
   - **Security Lead**: Ensures security review is part of DoD
   - **Operations Manager**: Ensures operational readiness criteria are included
   - **Data Analyst**: Ensures instrumentation and metrics collection are part of DoD
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
   - **Operations Manager**: Identifies infrastructure dependencies
   - **Support Lead**: Identifies documentation and training dependencies
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
  - **Security Lead**: Identifies and owns security risks
  - **Operations Manager**: Identifies and owns infrastructure/operational risks
  - **Data Analyst**: Identifies and owns data quality and analytics risks
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
  - **Support Lead**: Flags dependencies on documentation and customer communication
